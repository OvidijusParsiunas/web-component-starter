# Web Component React Wrapper

Example of how to wrap a web component in order to make it work in React. This is required due to React web component incompatibilities that are referenced inside the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/web-components.html) and are tested in [custom elements everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).

## :rocket: Setup commands

```npm install```

Installs node dependencies.

```npm run build```

Builds the wrapper component.
